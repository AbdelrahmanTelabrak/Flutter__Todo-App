# To-Do List App

## Overview

This To-Do List app is developed as part of a virtual internship with TeknoSoft. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features such as task categories, priority levels, and a user-friendly interface. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and uses the Provider package for state management.
